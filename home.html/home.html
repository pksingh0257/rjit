		<div class="a">
			<p>The Rustamji Institute of Technology (RJIT) is the first engineering college in India established by a Para Military Force. Due to deployment of the bulk of the Border Security Force (BSF) personnel in militancy affected areas, the majority of the force personnel stay separated from their families and are unable to look after the education of their children.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="a">
			<p>
				The RJIT gives educational opportunities to the children of serving BSF personnel as well as for those who have laid down their lives in service to the nation, for acquiring higher technical qualifications. The Border Security Force education fund sponsored the development of the institute.
